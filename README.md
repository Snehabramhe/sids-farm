# Sid's Farm Clone

Sid's Farm started as a simple promise from a father to his son to provide him with the purest, safest milk possible.

Tested daily for antibiotics, hormones, and additives - it takes more tests than any college kid! Only milk that aces every test is delivered to your doorstep.
We're setting the benchmark for doubt-free dairy: backed by science, sustained by effort, and a promise to protect every family we serve.



# Created with React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
